            <h3>United Federation</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gn60P1H.png" alt="United Federation Logo">
            <p>The United Federation is a powerful union of states and provinces, combining the resources and strength of North America under a single banner. The Federation is one of the most powerful nations on Earth, known for its strong military power, and global influence. It’s considered the safest empire to live in, with its highly developed security infrastructure ensuring protection for its citizens. Though its ethics are often questioned due to aggressive policies and controversial decisions, the Federations commitment to stability and order makes it a secure place to reside. The United Federation plays a key role in maintaining Earths overall stability and composure, using its vast resources and influence to manage global affairs. However, its methods of governance are considered unconventional, often relying on strict control and advanced surveillance systems to keep order. While effective, these measures sometimes blur ethical lines, raising concerns among critics. The United Federations governing structure is unique, diverging from the typical president and vice president system found in many nations. Instead, it is led by a group known as High Command, consisting of 13 High Commanders and 13 Interim High Commanders. This dual leadership model is designed to ensure continuity and balance of power, with High Commanders making key strategic decisions while their Interim counterparts act as immediate successors or advisors. This system, though unconventional, allows for greater specialization and strategic oversight, but it also raises questions about transparency and the concentration of power within the federation. Though its power is vast, it is also known for its controversial practices, including strict memory control to ensure loyalty.</p>

            <p>The Void Special Forces is an elite branch within the United Federation, specializing in covert operations and high-stakes missions that often involve interacting with the Void and the interdimensional realms associated with it. These operatives are trained to navigate both extreme environments and supernatural threats, leveraging their unique connection to the Void to enhance their capabilities. The unit maintains close ties with the heavens, receiving blessings and support that empower their effectiveness in the field. With advanced void technology and rigorous training, the Void Special Forces are equipped to tackle complex challenges, ensuring the safety and security of the federation in both terrestrial and astral areas.</p>

            <h3>Elite Honor Guard</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fZ9WSNG.png" alt="Elite Honor Guard Logo">
            <p>The Elite Honor Guard, nicknamed `The Federal Crowns` are the towering ceremonial and protective force of the United Federation’s highest officials, representing absolute loyalty and power. They stand at an average height of 8 feet, but depending on their rank and purpose, some guards undergo further augmentation, enabling them to exceed this stature. The tallest of these warriors stands at an awe-inspiring 9`4, a living monument to the Federation’s mastery over human enhancement. Each honor guard is augmented with cybernetics and exo-frame modifications that enhance their strength, agility, and reflexes. Their neural interfaces are synced with advanced mono-goggles equipped with ballistic trackers, which link to their co-pilot AI, granting them near-perfect aim in combat. This technology, combined with their enhanced physical stature, makes them not only imposing but lethal in both ceremonial and real-world defense scenarios. Those of higher rank, or those tasked with guarding the most critical personnel or locations, receive additional augmentations, such as reinforced skeletal structures and advanced neuro-circuitry, further increasing their size and capabilities. These elite members of the guard are often over 8 feet tall, with the tallest reaching a staggering 9`1. This elite subgroup commands not only fear but immense respect due to their rare physical and mental enhancements, setting them apart even among the Honor Guard. The Elite Honor Guard serve as both protectors and symbols. Their augmentations are as much a statement of power as they are tools of war, ensuring that no threat goes unanswered in the defense of the United Federation’s leadership and values.</p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4Ec3eE0.jpeg" alt="The Frost Shield Logo">
            <p>The Frost Shield is a powerful empire that dominates the Middle East, ruled by the authoritarian President, Mr. Snow. Driven by a deep hatred for the United Federation, the Frost Shield constantly seeks to undermine and sabotage its operations, using covert tactics to disrupt the Federation's influence. Their propaganda paints the Federation as an oppressive force, dehumanizing its citizens and demonizing its leaders. The Frost Shield believes that the Federation’s ideals must be toppled, viewing themselves as the true defenders of freedom and autonomy. As the primary antagonists of the story, they are relentless in their pursuit of dominance, aiming to reshape the world by any means necessary.</p>

            <h3>Skeeter Boyz</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CMdUY6J.png" alt="Skeeter Boyz Logo">
            <p>The Skeeter Boyz are a rebellious gang that thrives on the fringes of Federation society, operating in the abandoned and neglected districts that the government has long since forgotten. While not a major military threat, their influence is significant in the areas they control, where lawlessness and chaos reign. The gang is notorious for defying the Federation’s laws, taking advantage of the Federation’s inability to fully police these outlying regions. The Skeeter Boyz live by their own code, often engaging in petty crime, smuggling, and acts of sabotage.</p>

            <h3>Hawaiian Boys</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JdgOdba.png" alt="Hawaiian Boys Logo">
            <p>The Hawaiian Boys, known as the Tiki Soldiers, are a laid-back but strong gang with a reputation for their "chill" lifestyle and their love for the island vibes. They’re known for their welcoming attitude, always willing to help those in need when they can, and they’ve earned a strong reputation as the good-natured gang that doesn’t seek trouble, unless provoked that is. While often seen as a joke by rival gangs due to their "tiki" aesthetic, complete with Hawaiian shirts and carefree attitudes, the Hawaiian Boys are no pushovers. When their territory or friends are threatened, they’re quick to unleash their full force. In the story, they play a key role in Rowan's recovery depending on the path taken, helping him regain a sense of purpose and bringing new life to him. In exchange for their help, Rowan is inducted into their ranks, wearing a Hawaiian shirt as a symbol of his bond with the Tiki Soldiers. Despite their relaxed demeanor, the Hawaiian Boys prove that even the most carefree individuals can strike fear when necessary.</p>

            <h3>Chaos Gang</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DZKo8Oz.jpeg" alt="Chaos Gang Logo">
            <p>The Chaos Gang is the most violent and confrontational faction, known for their aggressive, anarchic behavior. They thrive on chaos, constantly rioting against the Federation's forces and disrupting any semblance of order in their territories. The gang’s core belief is in total defiance of authority and law, viewing the Federation’s police forces as oppressive enemies. When they encounter anyone who isn’t part of their own, they see them as fair game—robbery, violence, or worse are likely unless the individual joins their ranks. Aggressive and unforgiving, the Chaos Gang sees themselves as freedom fighters, fighting back against the system in their own brutal way. They are a constant source of unrest, making them a serious threat to anyone caught in their path.</p>

Once a man, his body is now a grotesque fusion of human and insect, with hardened black skin, ant-like mandibles, and six glowing purple eyes that pierce through the darkness. He can no longer consume human food, and instead, he must feed on the flesh of others to sustain himself. Astraeus becomes a significant enemy later in the story.</p>

Driven by a massive sense of self-importance, he is quick to anger and has little regard for anyone or anything, seeing others as tools to be used for his personal gain. His leadership style is tyrannical, with little concern for the well-being of his soldiers or the moral implications of his actions. Septu's belief in his own superiority makes him both feared and despised, as he will stop at nothing to maintain his power and control over the Federation.</p>

            Demone is the sadistic and brutal High Commander of the United Federation Army, serving as Septu's most trusted left-hand man. Towering at an imposing 8 feet tall without any enhancements, his sheer size and presence are enough to intimidate anyone who crosses his path. Driven by a deep, burning rage, Demone has no regard for life, enjoying inflicting pain and suffering on those who fall under his command. His loyalty to Septu runs deep, and the two are often seen together, with Demone acting as the enforcer of Septu's will. He is a terrifying force, embodying cruelty and violence in equal measure.</p>
