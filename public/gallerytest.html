It’s considered the safest empire to live in, with its highly developed security infrastructure ensuring protection for its citizens. Though its ethics are often questioned due to aggressive policies and controversial decisions, the Federations commitment to stability and order makes it a secure place to reside. The United Federation plays a key role in maintaining Earths overall stability and composure, using its vast resources and influence to manage global affairs. However, its methods of governance are considered unconventional, often relying on strict control and advanced surveillance systems to keep order. While effective, these measures sometimes blur ethical lines, raising concerns among critics. The United Federations governing structure is unique, diverging from the typical president and vice president system found in many nations. Instead, it is led by a group known as High Command, consisting of 13 High Commanders and 13 Interim High Commanders. This dual leadership model is designed to ensure continuity and balance of power, with High Commanders making key strategic decisions while their Interim counterparts act as immediate successors or advisors.
